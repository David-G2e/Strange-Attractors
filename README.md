Overview
========
Strange Attractors is a program which models Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's), specifically the Lorentz Attractor, using VRUI 12.0-001 by Oliver Kreylos. StrangeAttractors.cpp is the most up-to-date file. 

Throughout this Summer Research Project I have learned so much: learning the communication between foreground and background thread, how triple buffers work, taking an extensive look to pointers within C++, impletementing ring buffers, and so much more. 

I learned how to add birth/death rate to particles, change particle colors over time, and add particles.
